My first step to developing 

Hello everyone, I'm very new to the world of developing/programming. I'm very keen on getting to grips with this new venture.
The world around us is now full of computers and technology, and like most young people I have grown up with them. It is now second nature to use these devices every day of our lives, therefore it only seems logical to get a better understanding of how these function.
Looking forward to the journey ahead, learning new and interesting skills, meeting new and wonderful people on the way.
